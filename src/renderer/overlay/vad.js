/*
 * SaySomething VAD — energy-based voice-activity detector for latched auto-stop.
 * Consumed by audio.js in the overlay renderer, and
 * unit-tested in plain node (test/vad-test.js) — hence the dual UMD-lite export.
 *
 * This is a PURE state machine: it takes a stream of RMS levels (the same levels
 * the worklet already computes for the waveform — no second analysis path) plus
 * the milliseconds elapsed since the previous sample, and reports when the user
 * has stopped speaking. It never touches the DOM, the mic, or IPC.
 *
 * Algorithm (see docs/SPEC.md v0.2 auto-stop):
 *   - Noise floor is adaptive: seeded from the first ~calibMs of audio, then it
 *     tracks the quietest recent level (drops instantly to a new minimum, drifts
 *     up only very slowly) so it follows the room's ambient noise, not speech.
 *   - Two hysteresis thresholds derived from the floor: a higher `speechThresh`
 *     to confirm speech, a lower `silenceThresh` to confirm silence. The gap
 *     between them keeps quiet speech tails and breaths from reading as silence.
 *   - Speech must be sustained above `speechThresh` for `speechOnMs` before the
 *     session is marked as "has spoken". Auto-stop NEVER fires before that — a
 *     session where the user never speaks is left for the max-utterance timer.
 *   - Once speech has occurred, contiguous time below `silenceThresh` accumulates.
 *     Any energy back above `silenceThresh` resets the accumulator, so a mid-
 *     sentence pause shorter than `silenceMs` can never cut the user off.
 *   - When the accumulator reaches `silenceMs`, `fire` is reported exactly once.
 *
 * push(rms, dtMs) -> {
 *   fire, hasSpoken, speaking, progress /* 0..1 toward cutoff *\/, floor,
 *   speechThresh, silenceThresh
 * }
