# Say Something, project handoff

Free, local voice dictation for Windows. Hold a key, talk, and your words show up at your cursor. Runs 100% on-device (whisper.cpp), no account, no cloud, no telemetry. The differentiator is the **drop pad**: catch your words in a floating puck and drag it onto any text box to drop them exactly where you want.

- **Repo:** https://github.com/bluejacketblackhawk/saysomething
- **Current release:** v0.2.0 (installer + portable). v0.1.0 was the first public launch.
- **Owner:** bluejacketblackhawk (`bluejacketblackhawk@proton.me`)

## Stack and hard constraints

- **Electron.** Main process is CommonJS; renderers are vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no framework, no bundler). **Zero runtime npm deps** (only Electron + electron-builder as dev deps). Keep it that way.
- **Transcription:** self-hosted `whisper.cpp` `whisper-server.exe` (v1.9.1) on `127.0.0.1:8737`, `POST /inference` multipart. Model `small.en` is bundled so it works offline out of the box.
- **Native input:** a self-compiled C# helper (`SaySomethingHelper.exe`) does the global keyboard/mouse hooks and text injection. It is compiled by the .NET Framework `csc.exe` that ships with Windows, which is **C# 5 only**, no string interpolation, pattern matching, tuples, `out var`, etc.
- **Privacy is the product.** Nothing leaves the machine. The one network exception (optional AI rewrite) is hard-gated to loopback (see below). Do not add cloud anything.
- **Voice/brand:** informal, no em dashes in user-facing copy. Aurora palette (cyan/teal/violet), **never orange**. Logo is a voice waveform, never an "S"/monogram.

## Architecture

```
Electron main (src/main)                     Renderers (src/renderer)
  main.js        boot + IPC wiring              overlay/   the listening pill + mic capture
  state.js       dictation state machine        pad/       the drop pad (drag-to-drop)
  helper.js      supervises the C# helper       settings/  the settings window
  windows.js     all BrowserWindows             welcome/   first-run greeting
  ipc.js         channel names + preload allowlists
  config.js      paths (%APPDATA%/SaySomething, bundled resources)
  hotkey-match.js  pure combo-modifier matching (unit-tested)
  stores/        settings.js, history.js  (JSON on disk, atomic writes)
  whisper/       server.js, client.js, streaming.js, formatter.js, rewrite.js, models.js
                                             src/preload/  per-window context-bridge preloads

native/SaySomethingHelper.cs   WH_KEYBOARD_LL + WH_MOUSE_LL hooks, SendInput injection,
                               clipboard, foreground window, JSON-lines over stdio
bin/                           whisper-server.exe + the compiled helper (git-ignored; built/staged)
build-resources/models/        bundled ggml-small.en.bin
```

### The dictation flow
1. The C# helper installs a low-level keyboard hook and reports only **watched** keys (the hotkey + its modifiers, plus Esc while recording) to `helper.js` as JSON lines.
2. `state.js` is the machine: hotkey down → overlay `listening` + mic capture; release under 250 ms → latch (hands-free, VAD auto-stop); longer hold → finalize. It builds a WAV, POSTs to whisper, runs `formatter.format`, optionally runs the AI rewrite, then injects via the helper (clipboard-swap paste or unicode type).
3. **Combo hotkeys (v0.2):** a binding is `{ vk, mods, name }`. `hotkey-match.js` matches generic modifiers (either Alt satisfies Alt). The helper sends a real-time key-state snapshot with every event so a modifier lost across a lock-screen can't cause a misfire.
4. **Drop pad (the differentiator):** hold the pad key (Right Alt default), talk, and the text lands in a floating puck, auto-copied. Grab the puck and drag it onto a text box; on release the renderer sends `pad:place {x,y}` and the helper clicks that point + pastes. Renderer streams `pad:move {x,y}` during the drag so the window follows the cursor.
5. **Optional AI rewrite:** off by default. Points at a **local** model server (Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible one like LM Studio / vLLM). `rewrite.js` `normalizeEndpoint()` refuses any non-loopback host and `fetch` uses `redirect:'error'`, so a transcript can never leave the machine even if a setting or a redirect tries.

## Build / run / test

```
npm install            # Electron + electron-builder
node scripts/setup.js  # one-time: fetch + verify whisper binaries and the small.en model
npm start              # run the app (electron .); compiles the C# helper on first run
npm test               # formatter / rewrite / wav / vad / streaming / hotkey-match
node test/helper-selftest.js   # spawns the helper, checks the stdio protocol (CI=1 skips clipboard read-back)
```

**Cutting a release**
```
# bump "version" in package.json, then:
npm run dist           # -> dist/SaySomething-Setup-<ver>.exe (NSIS) + dist/win-unpacked/
# portable zip is a manual zip of dist/win-unpacked:
#   Compress-Archive dist/win-unpacked/* -> dist/SaySomething-<ver>-win-x64-portable.zip
gh release create v<ver> -R bluejacketblackhawk/saysomething -t "..." -F notes.md \
  dist/SaySomething-Setup-<ver>.exe dist/SaySomething-<ver>-win-x64-portable.zip
```
Both artifacts are **unsigned**, so Windows SmartScreen says "unknown publisher" (More info → Run anyway). Code signing is unbought; see roadmap.

## What's done (v0.2.0)

- Core dictation: hold-to-talk, tap-to-latch hands-free + VAD auto-stop, live preview, smart formatting (punctuation, filler removal, spoken "new line", artifact strip), custom dictionary, history.
- **Combo hotkeys** (issue #1): bind e.g. Alt+T.
- **Configurable local rewrite endpoint** (issue #2): Ollama or any OpenAI-compatible local server, loopback-only.
- **Newline fix** (issue #3): whisper segment breaks are flattened before formatting.
- **Drop pad**: drag-to-drop (was click-to-place).
- Adversarial review after each feature; the review-found bugs (hotkey mis-route, stale-modifier misfire, loopback redirect bypass) are fixed.

## Roadmap / open items

- **macOS port** — someone asked for it. Full guide in `docs/MAC-PORT.md`. The whole JS layer + renderers + whisper protocol are cross-platform; the work is replacing the C# Windows helper with a macOS equivalent and the packaging.
- **Code signing** — Windows (SmartScreen) and macOS (Gatekeeper/notarization) both show "unknown/unidentified developer" while unsigned. Buying certs removes the scare screens.
- **Social preview / launch** — social banner is set; Ko-fi tip link is in the README.

## Docs

- `docs/SPEC.md` — intended behavior of every feature and the state machine.
- `docs/CONTRACTS.md` — module contracts, the settings schema, and the helper/IPC protocols.
- `docs/MAC-PORT.md` — how to recreate this on macOS.
